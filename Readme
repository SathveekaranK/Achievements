In my journey as a SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) player and scripter, I've accomplished a variety of goals that reflect both creativity and leadership. I’ve successfully built and managed in-game systems including TextDraw-based inventories, gang roleplay features, and economy balancing. I’ve played a key role in multiple faction roleplays, acting as a bridge between gangs and law enforcement to enhance immersive storytelling. I also resolved critical runtime issues during server development, optimized sprite handling, and contributed to stable server hosting using platforms like SNH. My roleplay decisions have earned me respect from factions while testing my ability to maintain alliances and navigate betrayal.
